This project is the root of the FLOW Server application.

This project has the following dependencies (beyond the libraries already present in the repository):
Google Web Toolkit 2.5.1
Google App Engine 1.7.7
Account on Amazon S3 with keys configured

Because the system needs private keys to uplad data to Amazon, there are a number of configuration file not checked in.
These files are:
war/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml

Both of these files can be easily generated by replacing the variables in the velocity template files with the proper values.
The templates can be found in the war directory. Creation of these files will be automated in an upcoming release.
