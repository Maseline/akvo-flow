## Functional design
The Dashboard is organised in sections, each of which represent a functional unit of the system. Each section links to its functional design document.
* [Surveys](functionalDesign/Surveys.md) - Create, edit and publish surveys
* [Devices](functionalDesign/Devices.md) - Manage the devices connected with your Akvo FLOW Dashboard
* [Data](functionalDesign/Data.md) - View, edit, import and clean data collected with Akvo FLOW surveys
* [Reports](functionalDesign/Reports.md) - Viewing and exporting data and results from your surveys
* [Maps](functionalDesign/Maps.md) - Shows the surveys collected with a GPS location as points on a map
* [Users](functionalDesign/Users.md) - Defining users and their permissions
* [Messages](functionalDesign/Messages.md) - Lists messages on your dashboard related to activity with surveys and data processing activity
* [Admin](functionalDesign/Admin.md) - Activities for super users (typically Akvo staff)
