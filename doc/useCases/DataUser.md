Javier would like to find out more about the project that is going on in his neighborhood. He was visited by a enumerator a few weeks ago and is now curious what is being done with that data and what effect the project is having on his community. He is not sure where to find this information out and has limited access to the Internet. (this persona could be used for anyone who would like to look at the data regardless of weather they live in the area or not or if they are public/private sector)
