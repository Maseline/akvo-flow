#### Lifestyle
Emily lives in a nice neighborhood in Nairobi. She lives with her husband and youngest child. She takes part in many conferences and networking events and works a lot in her free time. When she gets some time off she likes to go running with her husband and generally relax from her busy schedule

#### About her job
As Director of a Kenyan NGO that focuses on childhood education. The NGO employs twenty people and receives funding from numerous sources, both locally and globally. On a strategic level, she along with the management team, are responsible for the direction of the NGO. One of the big challenges that Emily faces is related to the strategy and structure of the NGO and its transparency. She also faces financial and human resources challenges due to funding cuts. She is trying to maintain the same portfolio of work with fewer resources. Emily generally has a very full agenda, especially with all the travelling to see donors and projects. She is the face of the organization. She is not particularly good with technology but understand some of its advantages, especially the power of social media to assist with awareness and fundraising. When it comes to technology within operations, she knows far less but is willing to listen to new ideas. Roles and responsibilities include:

* As she is not very tech savvy, she does not engage directly with the technology but wants to be able to easily see big picture analysis that is produced from the underlying data collection. She likes this to be quick and intuitive. 
* Use the analysis and information produced by the Project Manager to make final decision on the overall strategy and funding allocation. 
* Approving reports, getting funding and making high-level tech decisions

#### Attitude towards FLOW
Emily has never heard of FLOW mainly because she does not work in the water and sanitation sector.
