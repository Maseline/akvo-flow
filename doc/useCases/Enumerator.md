#### Lifestyle
Together with her family he lives in a small house in Kurland Village. There is electricity, but many power cuts and there is no computer or Internet at home. Transportation is always an issue. Mainly he travels by communal taxi but sometimes he can use transportation provided by the NGO. The work week is varied as it depends on when surveys need to be carried out, but in his free time he likes to play football with his children and spend time with friends in the village. 

#### About his job
Kopano is usually in the office only a few times a month, most of the time he is out on field visits undertaking surveys. The NGO he works for is undertaking continuous monitoring of water points in the Eastern Cape Province. This means he can be gone for long periods of time if he is in a different part of the Province. He has worked for the NGO in this role for one year having previously worked as an environmental educator for South African National Parks. He likes his job, taking pride in what he does. He likes technology but does not know too much about it as he has been doing the majority of surveys on paper, using a camera and GPS. His responsibilities when collecting data include:

* Charge phones, connect to Wi-Fi, use the Field Survey app, battery management and to calibrate the GPS
* Collect and submit surveys (note; expertise in the topic being surveyed and training in how to conduct an interview/survey is important as it will affect the quality of data that comes in.)
* Be an Ambassador of the NGO and FLOW.  He is the face of the data collection and will be a large factor in creating opinions within the community about the technology/project that he is working on.
* Be able to check transmission histories, so he can confirm that he has been able to submit data and complete his tasks. 

#### Attitude towards FLOW
Kopano has yet to use Akvo FLOW. He has heard of it as the NGO he works for has talked about beginning to use it. He is happy to learn new skills that will make his job easier but is apprehensive that it is going to be a steep learning curve, especially if there are complex instructions in English. He is also concerned the responsibility of having expensive technology and about having enough power to make sure that the phone remains charged.
