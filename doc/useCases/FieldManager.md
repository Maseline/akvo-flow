#### About his Job
He spends roughly half of his time in the office and the other half in the field. He has undertaken many field surveys and is happy that his NGO has a chance to utilize FLOW. His main responsibilities are organising the implementation of the data collection efforts, making sure they are done efficiently and that the data is reliable. His responsibilities include:

* Understanding all the tasks that an enumerator has to do as he is responsible for training them before the data collection begins He also has to be able to undertake basic troubleshooting when issues arise. 
* Using the dashboard for basic functions (Raw Data Manager, data cleaning, editing surveys, checking maps). He also needs to understand how the phones and Dashboard interact as this is important to be able to resolve issues when they arise. 
* He is responsible for implementing the projects on the ground in terms of logistics of the data collection effort, eg how many vans, bikes, enumerators, most efficient collection schedule, implementing the sampling scheme laid out by his project manager, etc

#### Attitude towards FLOW
Cruz is excited to use FLOW. He has used other mobile data collection tools but is intrigued to see how the functionality of FLOW compares. His main concern is being able to undertake training with unreliable Internet connections in the field.
