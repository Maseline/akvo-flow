#### Lifestyle
Joythi lives with her daughter in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of Washington DC. She owns a car but commutes via bike. When she is not working she is busy driving her daughter to school or cello practice and enjoys spending time which her sisterâ€™s family, who live close by.  She travels quite a lot with work but tries to keep it to a minimum as she does not like to be away from her daughter.

#### About her job
Joythi isin the office most of the time but spends some time in the field to oversee various stages of the projects she manages, generally towards to beginning and the end. Her boss is the ultimate decision maker but her opinions carry great weight as she is in charge of the day to day running of the project. She is pretty tech savvy and likes to explore new ways of doing things. Her area of expertise is sanitation and her region of expertise is South Asia. Her roles and responsibilities include:

* She is the master Dashboard user and is responsible for adding users, creating surveys, testing surveys, approving changes to surveys, ultimate responsibility for data cleaning and analysis and creating final reports
* Advanced tech support for phones, telling field staff when they need to update phones. In conjunction with the field manager working on procuring the mobile phones. This may be done locally or might be done by HQ
* Field logistics - choosing sample size, how much data is collected and in what regions

#### Attitude towards FLOW
Joythi has used a FLOW for a small trial project and liked what it could do. She is looking to scale up and use it on larger projects but first must get clearance from her boss, who is not tech savvy. So she needs to display its utility to him which is best done in the form of results and increased efficiency in data collection and management. If she does get clearance then her main concern is how she can train a large group of enumerators who would be contracted to perform the surveys and who would be supporting her through the process. This is important because not only does she want good results but she is also accountable to her boss for the project. The ability to monitor the same point over time is critical to her. She is also concerned about how to tie this project into other ones in different areas of the world focusing on the same sector.
